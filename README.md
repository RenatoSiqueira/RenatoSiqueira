## 🧠 Engineering Profile

- Senior Fullstack Engineer with **backend-first mindset**
- Strong mastery of **TypeScript as a systems language**
- Proven experience in **application and system architecture**
- End-to-end ownership: from design to production
- Frequent work on **B2B, internal tools and government systems**
- Engineering decisions driven by cost, risk and scalability

---

## 🏗️ What I Build

- Robust APIs and well-defined contracts
- Multi-tenant systems and RBAC
- Internal dashboards and admin panels
- Complex third-party integrations
- Operational automation through code (not low-code)
- Conversational systems using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

> **Note:** I have evaluated tools like *n8n*,  
> but **do not use n8n in production systems**.  
> I prioritize code-based solutions for versioning,
> control, predictability and long-term maintainability.
